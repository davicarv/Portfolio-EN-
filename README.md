Data Analysis Project Portfolio  

## **1. CarSales:**  🚗📊 Car Sales Data Analysis  

This project aims to analyze trends and patterns in car sales using a realistic dataset from Kaggle. Through data exploration, processing, and visualization, valuable insights about purchasing behavior were generated. As a final step, an interactive dashboard was developed for comprehensive analysis.  

## 📌 Technologies Used  
- **Python & Pandas** → Data manipulation and cleaning  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** → Graphical visualization of results  
- **Jupyter Notebook** → Project structuring and development  
- **Power BI** → Interactive dashboard creation for insights visualization  

## 🎯 Demonstrated Skills  
✅ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** → Data cleaning, transformation, and exploration  
✅ **Data Visualization** → Creating charts and dashboards to identify patterns and trends  
✅ **Insights Extraction** → Evaluating sales seasonality and the impact of different variables  
✅ **Data Storytelling** → Logical organization of results for presentation  
✅ **Business Intelligence** → Building a Power BI dashboard for interactive analysis  

The CarSales folder contains the project notebook and the .pbix dashboard file.  

This project can serve as a reference for similar analyses in the automotive industry or any context involving sales and consumer behavior. 🚀
